# MyWebAPICodingQuiz

## Description

This project involves creating a coding assessment that includes multiple-choice questions and interactive challenges. The objective is to develop a timed code quiz with multiple-choice questions. The app runs in the browser, featuring dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code, and has a clean, polished, and responsive user interface that adapts to various screen sizes.

This timed code quiz is designed for coding bootcamp students who want to take a JavaScript fundamentals quiz that stores high scores, allowing them to track their progress and compare it with their peers.

The quiz includes:

- 5 questions in a timed manner, which decreases the time by 10 seconds with each incorrectly answered question.
- When all questions are either answered or time runs out, the game is over and a page renders, allowing the user to input their initials (maximum of 3 characters) to save their score.
