# 🏗️ Module 4 Challenge

* This application used and covered the skills learned from Modules 1-4 (HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Web API) to create a dynamic application with self-written code, which renders a responsive & timed coding quiz, covering some informational bits which we've worked through regarding Web API's!
It includes:  5 questions in a timed-manner which decreases the time by 10 seconds with each incorrectly answered question.  When all questions are either answered, or time runs out, the game is over and a page renders, which allows the user to input their initials with max character input as (3) in order to save their score.
